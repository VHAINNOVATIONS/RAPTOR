  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  	<p>This guide documents how to further enhance a Forena implementation by taking advantage of various integrations
		of Forena with other Drupal modules that further extend Forena's capabilities, such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the locale module included in Drupal to enable translation of reports in multiple languages.</li>
		<li>Use the {feeds_module} to create nodes using Forena data blocks and/or reports.</li>
		<li>Use the {bean_module} to create drupal blocks out of Forena reports.</li>
		<li>Use the {views_module} with Forena to create additional more complicated layouts than can typically be created
			using views. Forena provides a views rowstyle plugin that lets you use a forena report to format the output of a view.</li>
		<li>Use the {masquerade_module} to review (experiment with) all sorts of Forena related authorizations.</li>
		<li>Use a <strong>WYSIWYG editor</strong> to edit the body of a report, to avoid editing the specifications of the report
			body using XHTML tags.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="locale">Translating Reports</h2>
		<p>Forena includes support for report translations in multiple languages. To enable this support simply
		{enable_locale} which is included in Drupal core. Unlike other approaches at localization, because Forena allows full HTML markup, each report must be translated into the target language. </p>
	<h2 id="feeds">Feeds Importing</h2>
		<p>Using the Forena integration with the {feeds_module} it is possible to import data blocks and reports as
		Drupal nodes or Drupal users).</p>
	<p>
		For a  tutorial about the available features check out the video about <a
			href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg4P747DmE8" target="_blank">How to import data and reports based on data as Drupal
			nodes</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="bean">Bean Integration</h2>
	<p>
		For anyone not familiar yet with the {bean_module}, here is a quote from the bean project page: <strong>Bean</strong> is an
		acronym that stands for <strong>B</strong>lock <strong>E</strong>ntities <strong>A</strong>ren't <strong>N</strong>odes. Drupal blocks placed in
		regions are currently not entities, but the BEAN module creates block entities that can be placed in regions of your theme.
	</p>
	<p>
		By using the Forena integration with the {bean_module}, it is possible to create Drupal blocks that display Forena reports.  An instance of a 
		particular report with a particular set of parameters can be created as a block using the bean module. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Notes</strong>:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This integration was implemented without creating a {bean_module} dependency in Forena. If the {bean_module} is
			 installed and enabled, the integration can be used.</li>
		<li>Don't confuse Drupal blocks with Forena's data blocks.  There are different concepts.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Example</h3>

	<p>
		As an illustration of how to use this feature, let's create a block showing a condensed version of the {tutorial_toc_report} report:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Ensure that the {bean_module} is available (installed and enabled).</li>
		<li>Navigate to the {admin_content_blocks} page. Select 
			{block_add}. If <strong>Forena report</strong> was the only option available block types (i.e. no other Drupal
			module is in use that also integrates with the {bean_module}), then the {block_add} link will take you straight to the
			{block_add_forena} page Otherwise refine your selection until you get to this page.
		</li>
		<li>Enter these options on this {block_add_forena} page:
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Label</th>
					<td>Forena Docs</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Title</th>
					<td>Reporting Documentation</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Select a report (within Settings)</th>
					<td>help/toc</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>URL Parameters (within Settings)</th>
					<td>show_chapters=0</td>
				</tr>
			</table> After you entered these values, hit the <strong>save</strong> button.
		</li>
		<li>After saving this newly created block you'll be rerouted to the
			{admin_content_blocks} page again. This page will now display a table with at least a line corresponding
			to the newly created block.

		</li>
		<li>At this point we have the requested Forena report block available, but it isn't showing up anywhere yet, because the
			block is has not been placed into a region of our theme. Visit the {admin_structure_block} to place this block in your theme per 
			the normal drupal instructions. 
		</li>
	</ol>		
	<h2 id="viewsrowstyle">Views Integration</h2>
		<p>Using the Forena integration with the {views_module}, it is possible to use Forena reports as a views row
		style, so that in a view you can use the Forena templating engine to do the formatting. Although this can be done 
		through the views templating engine Forena users may find they have more control with this engine.</p>
	<h2 id="wysiwygeditors">WYSIWYG Editors</h2>
	<p>
		Forena's {wysiwyg_editor} facilitates the editing of the <strong>body</strong> of a report using a WYSIWYG editor (so that you
		are not assumed to be familiar with HTML tags to understand or edit the specifications of the report body). But because of the
		custom (FRX) attributes, some challenges need to be addressed:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Forena will (a) save away custom attributes in the report body before presenting it for editing via a WYSIWYG editor
			and (b) merge them back in after editing ended.</li>
		<li>Forena adds back the special tags that were stripped based on id attributes, but it also makes sure that there is an
			id on every HTML tag that has an FRX attribute.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some recommendations to prevent issues when attempting to enable a WYSIWYG editor for editing the body of a report:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Complete your homework first regarding {text_formats}! Doing so will prevent a lot of trouble with just any WYSIWYG editor.</li>
		<li>Be careful in selecting a WYSIWYG editor so that it doesn't conflict with the FRX attributes.  At a minimum id attributes 
		cannot be stripped by the editor.  Forena makes an attempt to read any custom attributes based on html id attributes, but if these 
		are stripped, all custom frx:attributes can cause problems.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some more details about available WYSIWYG editors for editing the body of a report:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>TinyMCE</strong> editor works provided when configured with these options:
			<ul>
				<li>Verify HTML.</li>
				<li>Remove Line Breaks.</li>
				<li>Convert Font Tags to Styles.</li>
			</ul> Warning: TincyMCE will strip out SVG graphs from any report it is used to edit.
		</li>
		<li>It should work with other WYSIWYG HTML editors, however {ckeditor_issue} seems to cause problems as it strips id attributes by default. You will 
		    need to set the allowed Content option on CKEditor to make sure it does not strip them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you have experience with other editors that you'd recommend to  include here, or you noticed anything
		that's incomplete, please report about it in the {forena_issue_queue}.</p>
