Forena Reports

Enterprise Reporting module that provides a mechanism for writing reports 
in a modified html syntax.  This module leverages XML, and for this 
reason required PHP 5.2 in order to run correctly. 

Installation
------------

Install in your sites/all/modules folder per the normal module installation 
method. 

After saving your settings, visit your my reports page to see Forena Documentation (reports/help.toc).  Further 
instructions for installing and configuring Forena may be found in the Setup Guide.
