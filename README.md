RAPTOR
======

Radiology Protocol Tool Recorder

RAPTOR is an automated, electronic tool for capturing data that is needed by radiologists to optimize advanced medical imaging protocols including CT, MRI and nuclear medicine. RAPTOR helps to optimize advanced medical imaging protocols at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) by automating an existing paper-based, error-prone manual process that can take weeks to complete. RAPTOR improves upon the existing system by capturing medical device data automaticall from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).

This automated installation process will create a RAPTOR system on a Linux-based virtual machine.

- Open your terminal application such as a shell under Linux, Command Prompt under Windows, or Terminal.app on Mac.
- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/RAPTOR.git
- Use the cd command to go to the root folder of the repository
- Type the following command to build RAPTOR:
```
vagrant up
```
To provision in AWS adjust your environment variables or modify the 'aws' section of the Vagrantfile and execute:
```
vagrant up --provider=aws
```

Credentials
-----------
Raptor Site (default site is 500)
http://192.168.33.11/RSite500/
username: admin
password: raptor1!

Configuration
-------------
The following values may be changed to suit your environment:

If you have a vista system with a very long workload listing, this value can be adjusted to make the worklist more managable:
```
OLDEST_WORKLIST_TICKET_ID = 30000
```

Troubleshooting
---------------
You must have a non demo version of cache and a valid license key otherwise
you will get the following:

Crash on D ^ZU

ref: https://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg01755.html 

> VistA logon (the ZU program) displays
>         "** TROUBLE ** - ** CALL IRM NOW! **"
> if the number of available jobs drops below 3. For those of us with
> small Cache licenses, this is a permanent condition, so you may decide
> to edit the ZU program to change the threshold.
