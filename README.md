RAPTOR
======

Radiology Protocol Tool Recorder

RAPTOR is an automated, electronic tool for capturing data that is needed by radiologists to optimize advanced medical imaging protocols including CT, MRI and nuclear medicine. RAPTOR helps to optimize advanced medical imaging protocols at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) by automating an existing paper-based, error-prone manual process that can take weeks to complete. RAPTOR improves upon the existing system by capturing medical device data automaticall from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).
